An analysis on students alcohol consumption.

Hue allows us to easily make subgroups within Seaborn plots, thus the subgroup "location"
School is represented by the initials of school the student attended - either "GP" or "MS".
Created a scatter plot where the plot points were colored based on whether the student lived in an urban or rural area.
How many students live in urban vs. rural areas, and does this vary based on what school the student attends.
It was observed that students with more absences ("absences") had tendencies of lower final grades ("G3").
First semester grade does correlate with the final grade, regardless of what kind of support the student received.
