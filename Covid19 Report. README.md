Project Overview
The "Covid19 Report Analysis" project focuses on analysing collated data during the global epidemic and to aid better understanding of the various degrees of affected countries. The primary objective is to report and visualise insights that are accuurate and can accurately estimate the cases of covid reported across all WHO Regions. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, contains information on factors such as Country/Region, Active cases, Deaths, Confirmed and more.
By analyzing these features, the project aims to provide valuable insights for health offiials, students, medical officers who any interested party.

Data Dictionary
The project utilizes a dataset with 187 rows and 15 columns, each representing different attributes related to covid19. Here is a brief overview of the columns: 'Country/Region', 'Confirmed', 'Deaths', 'Recovered', 'Active',
       'New cases', 'New deaths', 'New recovered', 'Deaths / 100 Cases',
       'Recovered / 100 Cases', 'Deaths / 100 Recovered',
       'Confirmed last week', '1 week change', '1 week % increase',
       'WHO Region

Impact
The project's impact is mainly twofold. Firstly, it addresses the need for effective means of curbing or reducing the rate of infection in some countries, especially countries/regions found to have a high population. Accurate analysis can help relevant authorities, organisations or concerned bodies to make well informed decisions.
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), significant insights have been uncovered. The analysis revealed some similarities in the analysis for most deaths and most number of active cases with at least four countries in common. 
In conclusion, the "Covid19 Report Analysis"  project provides valuable insights into the severe case of covid19. 
The projectâ€™s utilisation of python libraries highlights its accuracy and effective methods of analysing, leading up to a valid, insightful and accurate report.
